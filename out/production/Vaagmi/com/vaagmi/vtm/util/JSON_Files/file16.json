Last year marked the fifth year of increased giving, but the chairman of the Giving USA foundation said charities had not expected to reach pre-recession levels for a few more years.\n\n\"We know as the economy improved, things would get better. We were just not sure what that point would be,\" said Keith Curtis, chairman of the Giving USA Foundation.\n\nIn 2014, giving increased from individuals, corporations, foundation and bequests, according to the Giving USA report, which was released Tuesday. Total giving increased by 7.1 percent from 2013 to 2014.\n\nThe annual Giving USA annual report is based on tax returns and other data collected by researchers in the Lily Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University.\n\nMost of the increases in donations to America's more than 1 million charities were attributed to the improved economy. The economic downturn did not halt charitable giving, but the recession slowed it down and some Americans switched their donations toward human services during the recession, Curtis said.\n\nDonors are now supporting many of the same causes they donated to pre-recession, although giving to religious causes has not grown as fast as other areas, including human services, education, the environment and the arts.\n\nGiving to religious organizations still makes up the largest percentage of all U.S. donations \u2014 32 percent in 2014 \u2014 but its dominance in philanthropy has been dropping for the past 30 years. In 1987, charitable giving to religious organizations represented 53 percent of all donations.\n\nThis downward trend is related to the decrease nationally in religious participation. People don't give to churches they don't attend, Curtis noted, but they continue to give to social service agencies run by religious groups.\n\nNonprofits learned a lot during the recession, Curtis said, and they came out of the economic downturn stronger, more strategic and with better donor relations. \"Most of us weren't well prepared. We didn't realize how deep and long it would be,\" he said.\n\nCurtis said he hopes they will remember the experience and continue to plan for and be cautious about future economic volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

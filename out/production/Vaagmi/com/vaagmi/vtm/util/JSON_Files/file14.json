But if you don\u2019t look closely at Twitter, you could be missing out on some crucial job and networking opportunities.\n\nTwitter offers a strong network of people in various fields, and companies and hiring managers are increasingly sharing open positions on their accounts.\n\n\u201cIt offers less structure as a job search tool, but more opportunities to connect with people,\u201d said Pamela Skillings, an interview coach and founder of\n, a job coaching program. \u201cYou can stumble on an opportunity that you might not otherwise find.\u201d\n\nHere are some tips to get the most out of your Twitter job hunt:\n\n\n\nFirst, think of your Twitter profile as your brand: Include an identifiable photo, so recruiters recognize who you are.\n\nAnd don\u2019t underestimate that bio under your picture. \u201cYour bio is your elevator pitch,\u201d said Alyson Weiss, a social media coach. \u201cIt\u2019s your first chance to make an impression before people decide to click on you.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Skillings recommends including your Twitter handle on your resume. \u201cYou\u2019re giving people the ability to find you, and it shows a level of transparency.\"\n\n\n\nThe next step is to follow companies, recruiters, publications, job forums and industry leaders. Most brands don\u2019t have a lot of repeat engagement from individual users, which means you can stand out from the crowd if you retweet, favorite and reply to tweets in meaningful ways, experts say.\n\n\u201cJust join the conversation,\u201d said Ashley Stahl, a career coach to millennials. \u201cFind out who your potential boss would be, retweet them and reply to their tweets.\u201d\n\nToo often, however, people don\u2019t think of Twitter as a networking opportunity.\n\n\u201cTwitter wasn\u2019t branded as a professional network like LinkedIn, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be only personal,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cWe don\u2019t compartmentalize our real lives as professional versus personal.\u201d\n\nOnce you build up a personal conversation with a recruiter or manager, it\u2019s easier to direct message them to ask about connecting outside of Twitter or in person.\n\nSometimes, managers don\u2019t even have an official job posting. Christa Freeland, now the marketing manager at the venture capital firm Powershift, found a job in 2011 at Journyx, a software company, when she started following an employee there who would later be her boss. When she saw he'd tweeted about an open social media marketing role, Freeland immediately applied for the position.\n\n\u201cMy boss was very smart about it,\u201d Freeland said of his search for the perfect candidate, adding that the company didn\u2019t actively promote the position anywhere else but on its social media accounts. \u201cIt was about finding a marketing person through social media.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne way to sort through Twitter is to create a list for target companies, Weiss suggests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming with so much content, since you turn around for a second and you have 200 missed tweets,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a list, you can see job opportunities from specific companies.\u201d\n\nYou can set your list to public or private, and add as many users to it as you like. Clicking on a list gives you a timeline of tweets from just those individuals and companies.\n\n\n\nYou can use Twitter\u2019s built-in search bar for job openings: Type in a location, \u201chiring\u201d and seniority level (like \u201centry level\u201d or \u201cdirector\u201d), and you\u2019ll likely see tweets about open positions in your desired area.\n\nThere are also job search engines specifically for Twitter, like\n, which allows users to add in filters by location, industry and keyword.\n\nHiring managers are more frequently combing Twitter for applicants, particularly in fields where social media acumen might be considered a qualification for a job, like in HR and communications. Other industries -- like nonprofits and academia -- are starting to boost their Twitter presence too, Skillings said.\n\nCharlie Loyd, who creates cloudless satellite imagery at Mapbox, found his job after\nat five mapping companies and including a link to his portfolio. Mapbox responded in three minutes.\n\n\"I was frustrated, and I wanted to get this in front of someone,\" Loyd said. \"And there was no formal submission process for, 'Hey, I'm doing work that you haven't done before.'\"\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to stay up-to-date on recent business developments. If a company you follow recently received a large grant, for example, that might hint at a more aggressive round of hiring.\n\nIf you have an important interview coming up, experts agree it\u2019s important to look up your interviewer and potential managers ahead of time. Their recent tweets could be clues about what topics they\u2019re interested in and what the company culture is like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good small-talk opener,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cYou can ask, \u2018Did you see the news about subject X?\u2019 You\u2019re opening the interview in a knowledgeable way and putting yourself on equal standing with the hiring manager.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
